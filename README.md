# ActiveRecordValidationsInflector

This is a simple plugin that reads the metadata of your models and autogenerats validators in order to prevent posible validation errors generated by the database.

This works nicely for cases such as having a field with a defined lenght, let's say an varchar field with a length of 50, by the default if we don't add a presence validator on our model for the given field, ActiveRecord won't execute any validations over the provided value, if the value has a length greater than 50 characters, our storage engine will raise an exception and our rails app might display that lovable error screen we all like and love.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_record_validations_inflector', github: 'markmercedes/active_record_validations_inflector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_record_validations_inflector

## Usage

Inflecting validators in your classes

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  # only presence validators
  infer_validators :presence

  # only length validators
  infer_validators :length

  # multiple validators
  infer_validators :presence, :length

  extend AttributeValidatorFinder
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle exec appraisal install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec appraisal rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
